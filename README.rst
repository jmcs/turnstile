Turnstile - Local Git Hooks
===========================

Configurable local git hooks.

Installation
------------
You can install turnstile using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install turnstile-core

Alternatively, you can install it using setup.py:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ setup.py install

Adding and removing turnstile from a repository
-----------------------------------------------
To use turnstile in a repository, run ``turnstile install`` inside the repository.

To remove turnstile from a repository, run ``turnstile remove`` inside the repository.

Configuring turnstile
---------------------
You can configure the global hook behaviour by running ``turnstile config``.

Currently you can only configure the hook verbosity.

Repository configuration
------------------------
To use turnstile, you need to add a configuration file named ``.turnstile.yml`` to your repository.

You can find an example configuration in `turnstile repository <turnstile.yml.example>`_ and can learn more
about the configuration options in the `documentation <https://turnstile.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

Adding subcommands
------------------
Turnstile looks for command extensions in ``turnstile.commands`` entry points.

To make a new subcommand, create a `click <http://click.pocoo.org>`_ command named ``cmd`` and add the module with command
to your setup.py entry points in the 'turnstile.commands' group.

More information
-----------------
To learn more, check `turnstile's documentation <http://turnstile.readthedocs.org>`_.
